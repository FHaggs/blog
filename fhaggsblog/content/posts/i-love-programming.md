Is all software development today just about gluing frameworks and libraries together?

When I was a kid, I was captivated by Minecraft. The idea of creating my own world where I could be completely self-sufficient was fascinating. I could build a farm for food, create an infinite water source, and never have to rely on the "grid."

I always wanted this level of control in real life, but of course, it's impossible. There’s no such thing as infinite energy or food (though I still have plans to start my own farm someday).

Perhaps what drew me to programming was the idea of being the master of my own world. An isolated environment where everything happens in an ordered manner appealed to me then—and it still does.

I’ve always felt the urge to build something from scratch, but in today’s world, you can’t even make a [pencil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Pencil) from scratch anymore. Programming, however, felt like truly creating something from nothing.

As I gained more experience, my interest in operating systems and low-level programming grew. I also dabbled in web development and saw videos on YouTube discussing how modern development often involves just piecing together blocks of other people's code. This might be true for front-end developers, but not all projects are the same. I have limited experience as a professional programmer, so take my opinion with a grain of salt, but I believe those who complain about only using frameworks and libraries may not have worked on a real project.

For me, I still find great joy in writing abstractions and solving the puzzles that come with developing an application. Maybe I’m too young, and this passion for the craft will fade over time, but I don’t mind admitting that I genuinely love it. Some people think it’s cringe, but I do not care.
