You need your own website RN!!

It's so easy to become an internet landlord! Yet, most people choose the big tech route. Nowadays, the internet feels like it's just five big websites where people have profiles. The idea of the internet being reduced to just five websites is crazy! Becoming a digital landowner is a step toward decentralizing the internet, as it was originally intended. Having your own blog protects you from Facebook or YouTube's "content policies." Furthermore, these giants have already been co-opted by the government, so you can be intimidated by the law for what you post in these walled gardens.

The internet was a magical place when it was decentralized. Now, everything you see on apps like YouTube and Instagram is the same algorithmically enforced slop. So-called "content creators" have to bow to the platform's content police and its algorithmic manipulation. The internet has become a big echo chamber of what's "trendy," curated for you by The Establishmentâ„¢.

Since I truly believe in these principles, I will be posting on this blog from now on. Efforts will be made to find a more independent and free hosting solution for this blog. Stay tuned.
